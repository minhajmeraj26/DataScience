# The Sparks Foundation Tasks
This repository contains the tasks that I completed while working as an intern for The Sparks Foundation.

    ● Internship Category - Data Science and Business Analytics
  
    ● Internship Duration - 1 Month ( MARCH-2021 )
  
    ● Internship Type - Work from Home

# Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)

    ● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

    ● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

    ● You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool

    ● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

    ● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
    
# Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)

    ● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

    ● Use R or Python or perform this task.

    ● Data can be found at https://bit.ly/3cGyP8j    

# Task-3 : To Explore Business Analytics (Level - Beginner & Intermediate)

    ● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’

    ● As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.

    ● What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?

    ● You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel)

# Task-4 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism(Level - Intermediate)

    ● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’

    ● As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.

    ● What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?

    ● Dataset: Daily updated .csv file on https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5    
    
# Task-6 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm (Level - Intermediate)

    ● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

    ● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
      predict the right class accordingly.
